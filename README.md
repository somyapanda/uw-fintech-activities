# Activity 1 - FinTech and Me

So far, today has been all about course introductions and lectures. Now it's time to reflect a bit about the following question: 


* What does FinTech mean to you? Why is it important?

   Currently, I am looking for an opportunity related to the financial or technical sector. Previously in India, I used to work in a bank, so I have experience in the financial sector. But without technical skills, it is difficult to get a job. I believe this course will help me to gain substantial technical knowledge in the FinTech area. The new skills combined with my past experience should give me the ability to get the right job. 


* What about FinTech interests you?

   In the FinTech Bootcamp program, there are many new things for me to learn. I am very excited to learn about programming, financial fundamentals, and machine learning applications in the finance area. I like the Python programming language which is easy to learn and has a great community. In addition I am looking forward to learning some of the popular libraries in Python such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and tensorflow. 


* Where do you expect FinTech to take you? What are you looking to do?

   The FinTech Bootcamp program will provide me a platform, where I can prepare myself for job interviews. I would also like to get a deeper understanding of the interview process. It is going to be immensely helpful. I think the Bootcamp is a place where I can gain the knowledge and skills to build a new career in the FinTech industry and also make some new friends. I want to explore this field to acquire as much knowledge as possible. I am excited as well as quite nervous. I will give my best to succeed in this program.


* What about FinTech may be confusing? What makes sense?
