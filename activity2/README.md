## Research Report

### Payments and Remittances:

* A remittance is a payment of money that is transferred to another party. Broadly speaking, any payment of an invoice or a bill can be called a remittance. However, the term is most often used nowadays to describe a sum of money sent by someone working abroad to his or her family back home. The term is derived from the word remit, which means to send back. Remittance is the capital flow between individuals in two different countries, typically by foreign workers to individuals in their home country.
* The main purpose of remittance advice is to help suppliers match invoices with payments. Remittance advice should therefore include the invoice number, along with the payment amount and method of payment. Remittances play an increasingly large role in the economies of small and developing countries. They also play an important role in disaster relief, often exceeding official development assistance (ODA). They help raise the standard of living for people in low-income nations and help combat global poverty. We can transfer money easily, safely and in a faster way. Remittances are personal money transfers sent from workers in one country back to their country of origin. Due to different currencies and monetary systems, a remittance is processed by Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), who convert and transfer the money.
* Competitive landscape is a business analysis method that identifies direct or indirect competitors to help comprehend their mission, vision, core values, niche market, strengths, and weaknesses. Based on the volatile nature of the business world, where companies represent a competition to others, this analysis helps to establish a new mind-set which facilitates the creation of strategic competitiveness. The main contenders are increased use of technology and globalization of capital markets has decreased the scale at which many financial services can be provided efficiently and profitably. Fax was the most disruptive technology in this industry because it quickly allowed the spread of agents. Bitcoin is another one. Lending, Rabo-investment and crowdfunding.
* The main factors that change in the domain are the high fee associated with the services, the high friction associated with cash, agents, distribution networks, limited connections between banking institutions, etc. Nowadays, systems are becoming more open to allow for integrations through APIs, pieces technology can be added on to replace, automate, speed, make safer, make less risky, make more efficient, our internal systems.

* Migrant economic remittances are an important and growing source of foreign funds for several  developing countries. At present, these flows are more than double the official aid received by developing countries. In 2010, officially recorded remittances to developing countries reached $334 billion(World Bank 2010). In the past the growth was slow and less as compared to the present scenario. 
      
### Robo-advisors and Personal Finance:

* The main functions of RegTech include regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance. Regtech is a community of tech companies that solve challenges arising from a technology-driven economy through automation. The rise in digital products has increased data breaches, cyber hacks, money laundering, and other fraudulent activities.

Regtech tools seek to monitor transactions that take place online in real-time to identify issues or irregularities in the digital payment sphere. Regtech companies collaborate with financial institutions and regulatory bodies, using cloud computing and big data to share information. Cloud computing is a low-cost technology wherein users can share data quickly and securely with other entities.
